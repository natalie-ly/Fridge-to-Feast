## About the site
Oftentimes, we find ourselves standing in the kitchen, staring at the food in front of us, wondering what to even eat. Fridge to Feast is a website that recommends **a recipe based on the ingredients in a user's fridge or pantry**. With a simple photo, the user's cooking environment is more at ease. Each photo that is submitted is tagged using **Azure Image Tagging** to determine what ingredients are available and these tags are used to find a recommended recipe. *Currently, users are only able to submit the image address of the photo*
